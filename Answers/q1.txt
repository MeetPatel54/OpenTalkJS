**Description of the issue:**

I encountered an issue with the form submission on your website. When I submit a form, the data does not appear to be processed correctly. Instead of receiving a confirmation message or notification, the page reloads and redirects me back to the homepage.

**Steps to reproduce the issue:**

1. Visit the website [www.example.com](http://www.example.com).
2. Click on the "Contact Us" form.
3. Fill out the required fields (name, email, message).
4. Click on the "Submit" button.
5. Observe that the page reloads and redirects me back to the homepage.

**Expected behavior:**

The expected behavior is for the form submission to be processed successfully, resulting in a confirmation message or notification.

**Troubleshooting steps taken so far:**

I have tried the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Checked the website's network connection.
2. Verified that the browser and operating system are up-to-date.
3. Tried submitting the form multiple times to confirm the issue is not temporary.

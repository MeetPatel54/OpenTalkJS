"Moonlit Dreams"

The night is dark, the stars shine bright
A silver glow that cuts through light
The moon, a ghostly crescent shape
Lulls me to sleep with its ethereal escape

In dreams, I soar on wings of white
Above the world, where darkness takes flight
I dance upon the lunar tide
Where shadows weave a silken hide

 Memories of love and loss entwine
A bittersweet melody that's mine
The wind whispers secrets in my ear
Of joys and sorrows, hopes and fear

In this midnight hour, I am free
To roam the dreamscape, wild and carefree
No boundaries bind, no chains confine
I am a wanderer, lost in lunar time

But as the dawn begins to creep
The moon's pale light begins to seep
Into my soul, where shadows dwell
And slowly fade, like a ghostly spell

For though the night has been my friend
It's time to rise and face the day again
Though dreams will linger, whispers of old
I'll find my strength in morning gold.
